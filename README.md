# Asynchronous JavaScript Example
This is an example of using asynchronous JavaScript functions with async and await.

## Main Function (mainFunction)
The mainFunction is the primary function that combines several asynchronous operations. This function returns an error status based on the results of these operations.

## Operation Functions (operation1, operation2, operation3, operation4)
The operation functions are asynchronous functions that execute simulated asynchronous operations. They return an error status based on the random results of the operations.
