# Asynchronous JavaScript Example
This is an example of using asynchronous JavaScript functions with async and await.

Main Function (mainFunction)
The mainFunction is the primary function that combines several asynchronous operations. This function returns an error status based on the results of these operations.

# Operation Functions (operation1, operation2, operation3, operation4)
The operation functions are asynchronous functions that execute simulated asynchronous operations. They return an error status based on the random results of the operations.
